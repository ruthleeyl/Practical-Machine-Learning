# Practical Machine Learning
Repository for Coursera Practical Machine Learning Assignment

## Background
Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).  The data provided recorded features on the Euler angles (roll, pitch and yaw), as well as the raw accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer readings. For the Euler angles of each of the four sensors, eight features recorded are: mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, amplitude, kurtosis and skewness, generating in total 96 derived feature sets.

## Aim of the Project
The purpose of the project is to predict how well the people did the exercise indicated by variable "classe" (i.e. Class A, B, C, D or E). A prediction model will be built using the training dataset, tested on the validation dataset and subsequently applied on the testing dataset.

## Attachments
The project includes the following attachments: index.Rmd, index.md, index.html and exploratory figures (simple exploratory plots, classifciation tree and k-means clustering plots).
